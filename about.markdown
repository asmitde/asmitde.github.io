## <a id="about-me">üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me</a>
I am currently pursuing PhD in Computer Science and Engineering under the guidance of Dr Swaroop Ghosh in the Lab of Green and secure Integrated Circuit Systems ([LOGICS](https://personal.psu.edu/szg212)) at Penn State University. My research is on developing security designs in hardware for protecting RISC-V based SoCs and their supply chain.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Security Extensions for RISC-V:</strong> Developed a RISC-V hardware accelerator platform for protection against
            common memory corruption vulnerabilities, such as, buffer overflows using hardware shadow stacks, PUF-based
            randomized canaries, and hardware bounds checking.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Leakage Exploits using Hardware Trojans:</strong> Developed a hardware Trojan based system exploit that can
            leak data from a process‚Äôs address space and perform privilege escalation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Camouflaged Gates for Reverse Engineering Prevention:</strong> Developed a multi-input multi-function
            camouflaged gate based on threshold voltage logic to prevent reverse engineering of circuits. Developed a
            charge-trap and NV-FeFET based camouflaged gate to thwart RE attacks involving untrusted foundries.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Unified Overlay API:</strong> Prototyped a new unified API for overlay placement for peripheral CHISEL devices to
            facilitate faster and easier overlay instantiations for both FPGA and ASIC platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SiFive Address Guard Extension Module:</strong> Designed security architectures for policy-based memory protection
            in SiFive Core IPs. Implemented security module RTL using CHISEL and created system test code in C for design sanity checks.
