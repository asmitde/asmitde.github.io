title: Windows 11 is here! (Pt 1/2)
---

(Windows 11)[https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-11] is (un)officially a thing! There were several rumors
floating around the interwebs that the next version of Windows will be versioned 11; and the constant
(teases)[https://twitter.com/Windows/status/1400125115765907458] from Microsoft were definitely pointing to that.
Now, this is indeed confirmed by a leaked ISO for an unfinished Windows 11.

I am pretty excited about this next version of Windows, since this will be a significant UI overhaul
since Windows 10 launched in 2015 (wow, has it been that long?). So naturally, when I heard there
is a leaked build, I had to get my hands on it and check it out. I wasn't gonna install it on my
primary machine, even my secondary (**you should never trust software from unknown sources**); so
I decided to dust off my retired gaming laptop from 2014 (a Lenovo Y50-70) and bring it back to life.

## Installation attempt 1

Put in a spare Samsung 500GB SSD that I had, burnt the Windows 11 ISO to a USB stick, and boot up the
installation media. Hit install.

> Unable to install. Your computer does not meet the minimum requirements to install Windows. Visit aka.ms/some-nonexistent-link to check minimum requirements.

❓ 🤔 Huh...

## Installation attempt 2

Burnt a Windows 10 ISO to a USB stick, boot it up, hit install.

> Hi, I'm Cortana! And I'm here to help. A little sign-in here, a touch of WiFi there, and we'll
have your PC ready to go!

🙄 Okay...

Inserted the Windows 11 USB stick and launched `setup.exe`.

> This PC can't run Windows 11.
> Here's why:
> The PC must support TPM 2.0.

❗ Really? Maybe because this is an unfinished build. Or maybe it is a real requirement.

Whatever may be the case, I had to get around it somehow.

To be continued...
