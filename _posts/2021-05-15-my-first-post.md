Hi! Welcome to my first ever blog post.

I will keep this post short and simple - it is just to create a sketch of the things that I am planning on covering in the blog.

I am currently studying for my PPL license (FAA knowledge test), and wanted to document some of the concepts and topics that I am learning. So, in the aviation related series of posts, I am planning on having some short conceptual topics related to principles and aerodynamics of flying, aircraft systems, weather theory, etc. A bit of a disclaimer: I am not a physicist, aerodynamicist or a certified instructor, so needless to say, these are my understanding of the concepts and should **not** be used as official instruction for real world flying in any way.

In the aviation related series of blog posts, I will also cover tips and tricks on simulaiton flying - mostly in the new [Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://flightsimulator.com), and also some in [X-Plane 11](https://www.x-plane.com/).

Other than aviation/flightsim stuff, I will also have a series of tech/security/development related posts - still working on the topic details.

That's all for now - stay tuned! ðŸ™‚
