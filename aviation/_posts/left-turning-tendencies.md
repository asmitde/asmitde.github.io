title: Left Turning Tendencies
---

In a single engine propeller driven aircraft, there is a natural tendency of the aircraft to always veer to the left.

There are primarily four factors that contribute to the left turning tendency.

## Torque Effect

This is the most intuitive effect to understand. In almost all engines, the propeller spins clockwise as viewed from the cockpit. This causes a rotating counter-effect in the anticlockwise direction on the body of the aircraft, which creates a tendency to roll to the left. This is in accordance to Newton's third law of motion.

## Spiraling Slipstream

The rotating propeller causes a causes a spiraling vortex of air, known as propwash, that moves towards the rear of the aircraft. 
This vortex spirals round the fuselage and hits the left side of the horizontal stabilizer. This causes a yawing movement to the left.

## P-Factor

This effect is more pronounced at high angle-of-attack (AOA). Essentially in a nose-up attitude of the aircraft, the propeller disc is not exactly perpendicular to the oncoming wind, rather slightly slanted away from it. This causes an asymmetrical loading on the propeller blades.

One important thing to keep in mind is that propeller blades are designed like airfoils (wings).
Hence, in that slanted position, the descending blade on the right side has a high AOA and it
'bites into' a larger volume of air. On the other side, the ascending blade on the left has a low 
AOA and sweeps a lesser volume of air. Now because of this asymmetrical load, the right side
produces a higher 'lift' on the descending blade compared to the ascending blade on the left side.
As a result, there is a tendency to yaw to the left.

## Gyroscopic Precession

This is probably the least explained cause of left turning in private pilot aviation resources. The _Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge_
states this:

> Precession is the resultant action, or deflection, of a spinning 
rotor when a deflecting force is applied to its rim. As can be 
seen in Figure 5-49, when a force is applied, the resulting 
force takes effect 90° ahead of and in the direction of rotation.
The rotating propeller of an airplane makes a very good gyroscope and thus has similar properties. Any time a force 
is applied to deflect the propeller out of its plane of rotation, 
the resulting force is 90° ahead of and in the direction of 
rotation and in the direction of application, causing a pitching 
moment, a yawing moment, or a combination of the two 
depending upon the point at which the force was applied.

This explanation is at best inadequate, and glosses over a few things. Two questions that immediately comes to mind are:

1. What force is being applied to deflect the propeller?
2. The prop spins to the right, so why is the 90° deflection to the left?

To answer these questions, let us delve a little deeper into how gyroscopic precession works.

A gyroscope is a spinning disc, whose axis of rotation is free to change its orientation. Now, consider
